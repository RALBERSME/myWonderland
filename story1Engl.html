            Dorothy Gale, a young girl from Kansas, is swept away by a wild dust
            storm to the colorful Land of Oz. There, she soon meets a host of
            quirky inhabitants, all searching for something they already possess
            or desperately need: pride, courage, a heart, and brain.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, Dorothy encounters the Scarecrow, who has no brain; the Tin
            Woodman, who longs for a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who wishes
            for courage. All three join Dorothy as she sets out to find the
            Magic Tree of the Good Wizard, which is said to grant their wishes.
            Along the way, they encounter the windy path, a talking Scarecrow,
            who wishes he had a brain of his own, and other obstacles such as
            the dangerous Haunted Forest and the hostile Tree Cult. ...
          </p>
          <p>
            Arriving in the Emerald City, the group gets lost in the illusion
            that the Wizard of Oz can only help them with his great powers. But
            with courage, loyalty, and cooperation, they realize that the
            solutions already lie within them: The Scarecrow develops clever
            ideas, the Tin Woodman shows great compassion, and the Cowardly Lion
            secretly finds the courage to join them. Dorothy herself realizes
            how strong her home and family are when she feels homesick for
            Kansas.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get home from Oz, Dorothy and her friends set off again, guided
            by the Good Witch of the North Wind and aided by the Wizarding
            World, which prepares them for their return. In the end, the Wizard
            of Oz reveals that he is not a true wizard, but a human who used
            tools and tricks to help. Despite this revelation, the group
            receives what they were looking for: clarity about their own
            abilities. Dorothy finally returns to Kansas, realizing that home is
            where her heart is happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The journey remains a lesson about friendship, courage, compassion,
            and the meaning of home.

        <h4>
          "The Wizard of Oz" was filmed in 1939 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).
          The film was primarily directed by Victor Fleming, who, however, had
          to be available for "Gone with the Wind" before taking on the
          challenging project. The screenplay was written by Noel Langley,
          Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf, and the lead role of Dorothy
          was played by Judy Garland. The US theatrical release took place on
          August 12, 1939. Due to the war, the film was not released in Europe
          until later, in Austria in 1950 and in Germany in 1951. But see for
          yourself:
