          Let's start with what went on behind the scenes, but which no viewer
          noticed.
        </h2>
        <br /><br />

        The secret behind "The Wizard of Oz" includes, first of all, the
        dangerous production conditions on set. The filming was marked by
        numerous accidents:<br /><br />

        <strong> Buddy Ebsen - the Tin Man: </strong>He had to give up the role
        of the Tin Man due to a severe aluminum allergy. The toxic makeup made
        from aluminum powder severely affected him.<br /><br /><strong>
          Actress Margaret Hamilton</strong
        >

        suffered severe burns to her face and hands when the pyrotechnics
        ignited prematurely in a cloud of smoke during her farewell scene.

        <strong>
          <br /><br /><strong>Ray Bolger - the Scarecrow</strong> had to wear a
          tight, aggressively fastened rubber mask, which led to skin damage.
          Judy Garland - Dorothy</strong
        >

        was subjected to enormous pressure, forced to follow strict diets, and
        was medicated, which led to significant psychological problems.

        <br /><br /><strong>Oscar Diggs - the Wizard</strong>

        was not a real magician, but a Kansas carnival performer who ended up in
        Oz in his balloon. To demonstrate his power, he used illusions and a
        special apparatus to pass himself off as a powerful figure.

        <br /><br />There were rumors that a small performer had hanged himself,
        but this was exposed as a false claim.

        <h2>But the story itself is also shrouded in mystery:</h2>

        <br /><br />

        There are various interpretations that go beyond the obvious message
        that there's no place like home. These include political allegories
        relating to the US economy, as well as the actual origin of the work.

        <br /><br /><strong
          >Political Interpretations - Economic Allegory:</strong
        >

        One widespread interpretation is that the book is an allegory of US
        economic policy around 1873. The characters in "The Wizard of Oz" are
        often used as allegories for the political and economic situation of the
        USA in the late 19th century, particularly the populist movement and the
        debate over whether to maintain the gold standard for currency or begin
        using silver. The Scarecrow represents the American farmer who, despite
        a lack of formal education, possesses a pragmatic mind and was
        disadvantaged by the gold standard: The gold standard disadvantaged US
        farmers in several key ways: Price volatility and income fluctuations:
        Under the gold standard, the money supply and currency were pegged to
        gold. When gold was extracted from the ground or gold reserves
        increased, the money supply tended to decrease, promoting deflation.
        Prices for agricultural products often fell faster than costs, resulting
        in lower incomes for farmers and making debts more expensive in real
        terms.

        <br /><br />

        Fixed Money Supply vs. Growing Debt Demand: Agricultural production grew
        faster regionally than the money supply, especially during periods of
        economic growth or exploration and infrastructure projects. As a result,
        the real debt burden for farmers worsened, while their incomes did not
        increase at the same proportion.

        <br /><br />

        Credit Conditions: Under the gold standard, it was more difficult to
        respond flexibly to market conditions. Banks often maintained strict
        lending conditions as long as they had to cover gold reserves. During
        price anonymous periods or crop failures, it became difficult for
        farmers to refinance loans or pay interest.

        <br /><br />

        Price Sharing and Monopolies: Large agricultural producers and
        speculators could take advantage of price fluctuations, while
        smallholder producers faced greater pressure. The peg of the currency to
        gold limited the policy space available to directly stabilize prices or
        incomes. ... <br /><br />

        Political implications: Proponents of the gold standard argued that it
        curbs inflation and brings stability. Opponents emphasized that it
        pushes towards deflation and disadvantages farmers because debts become
        heavier in real terms. The farmers' movements (e.g., the Granger
        movement, later the populists) called for currency expansion, a silver
        or bimetallic solution to increase the money supply and loosen credit
        conditions.<br /><br />

        In summary, the gold standard led to deflationary conditions and a fixed
        monetary policy, which was detrimental to heavily indebted farmers and
        those with falling produce prices.<br /><br />

        <span>The Tin Man</span> represents the industrial worker who is
        dehumanized by hard labor but still demonstrates a willingness to
        cooperate;<br /><br />

        and the <span>Cowardly Lion</span> symbolizes reformers like William
        Jennings Bryan, who needed courage to stand up to the powerful.
        According to the book, courage is not the absence of fear, but the
        ability to act despite fear.<br /><br />

        <span>The Wizard</span> himself is a charlatan figure who represents the
        politically and economically powerful, but ultimately incompetent, upper
        class.<br /><br />

        <span>The Wicked Witch of the East</span> represents the economic
        influence of the East Coast, including the major banks and monopolies.

        <br /><br /><span>Dorothy</span> represents the average American
        citizen. <br /><br /><span>Toto</span> represents the Prohibition Party,
        as he is a small dog. <br /><br />

        <span>The hurricane</span> represents the economic upheavals of the
        time. <br /><br /><span>The yellow brick street</span> symbolizes the
        gold standard. <br /><br /><span>The silver shoes</span> represent the
        silver standard. <br /><br /><span>The emerald city</span>
        represents the illusory capital, Washington, D.C.

        <br /><br /><span>The emerald city</span>

        represents the illusory capital, Washington, D.C. Subversive Messages:
        Some critics see in the book a message about the power and authority
        that people blindly follow, even when it is undeserved. Other
        Interpretations suggest that the story can be interpreted as a journey
        of self-discovery, as the characters discover their own strengths
        through their journey. Another interpretation states that the book is a
        critique of the corruption and manipulative power of the state. Author's
        Origin: Many of these interpretations come from scholars and critics and
        are not necessarily the intended meaning of the author, L. Frank Baum.
        Written by L. Frank Baum, who published a total of 14 young adult novels
        and other books set in the world of Oz. Many of his followers argue that
        the book was simply meant to be a good story for children.
