          The story of "Alice in Wonderland" is about a girl named Alice who
          follows a white rabbit<br />
          with a pocket watch and tumbles into a fantasy realm full of bizarre
          creatures and events.<br />
          There, she experiences shrinking and growing again, <br />encounters
          characters like the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter,<br />
          and ends up in a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts and a court
          case.<br />
          In the end, it turns out that it was all just a dream<br />
          when she wakes up back at her sister's house.

        The plot in detail:<br /><br />

        One sunny day, bored with her reading, Alice follows the White Rabbit
        down a rabbit hole, which leads<br />
        to a long journey through a deep well.<br />

        Alice lands in a long corridor with many doors and must shrink by
        drinking <br />from a bottle or grow again by eating a cake to reach the
        right sizes.<br /><br />

        On her journey, she meets a Blue Caterpillar who advises her on the
        right size, and the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, who are having a tea
        party where time has stood still.<br />

        The Cheshire Cat leads her to a croquet game with the Queen of Hearts,
        who, furious over the red roses that her gardeners have mistakenly
        replaced with white ones, threatens to cut off everyone's head.<br /><br />

        Alice is summoned as a witness to a trial in which the Knave of Hearts
        is accused of stealing a biscuit. During the trial, Alice grows again
        and gets into an argument with the Queen before the scene dissolves
        around her into a swirl of playing cards.<br /><br />
        As the playing cards swirl around her, Alice suddenly wakes up in the
        park, where her sister comforts her and she realizes that it was all
        just a dream.<br /><br />
