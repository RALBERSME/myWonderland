      <h1>Hidden criticism:</h1>
      <br />
      "Alice in Wonderland" contains hidden criticism of Victorian society,
      satires of contemporary children's poetry, parodies, and multifaceted
      wordplay. The book can also be interpreted as a counterpoint to the rigid
      conventions of the time.

      <br /><br />

      Thus, Alice in Wonderland is seen as a counterpoint to the rigid
      conventions and rules of the Victorian era, creating a world in which a
      child must find their way without educational norms.<br />

      Lewis Carroll parodied many didactic children's poems of his time to
      create a more humorous narrative. There are both strong Christian
      references and allusions to paganism.

      <br /><br />

      Carroll used a variety of wordplay and puns to emphasize the absurdity of
      the story. The fluid narrative style was unusual for the time and
      contributed to the dynamism and continuity of the plot.

      <br /><br />

      An interpretation of the 2010 film suggests a feminist interpretation of
      the book. In this interpretation, however, Alice has become a confident
      young woman who forges her own path independently of traditional
      expectations.

      <br /><br />

      Through her directness, Alice exposes the egoism and absurdities of the
      adults, leading to a critique of the moral principles of the time.

      <br />

      <br />

      The story is initiated by a boat trip with the Liddell family and is thus
      deeply rooted in childhood experience. The experience of Wonderland, where
      the laws of logic and physics are suspended, can be seen as an exploration
      of the child's imagination and its ability to bend and shape reality.

      <br />

      There is a yearning to look beyond the surface of perception and follow
      childlike curiosity.

      <br /><br />
      <strong>Psychological Interpretation</strong>

      <br />

      <br />

      The whimsical and often absurd nature of Wonderland reflects<br />
      the chaos and unpredictability of the subconscious.<br />
      Wonderland forces Alice to confront her beliefs and fears. Many characters
      can be associated with mental disorders. Among them is the White Rabbit,
      which is associated with generalized anxiety disorder.<br />
      The Cheshire Cat's ability to disappear and distort reality is interpreted
      as a schizoid trait.

      <br />

      <br />

      <strong>Possible Alternative Interpretations</strong>

      <br />

      <br />

      In popular culture, the story is often interpreted as a metaphor for a
      drug trip, particularly through allusions in music and films, according to
      Deutschlandfunk Kultur.

      <br />

      <br />

      Although the book contains many hidden meanings and critiques, not all
      interpretations are accurate. Some theories that view the book as an
      allegory for drug use or sexuality are controversial.

      <br />

      <br />

      <strong>Meaning and the Search for Meaning</strong>

      <br />

      A deeper message of the book could be that the world often seems crazy and
      meaningless. Instead of frantically searching for deeper meaning, the
      story suggests enjoying the journey and the experiences themselves.
