        There exists a psychiatric syndrome (“Alice in Wonderland Syndrome”),
        named after the book, and characterized by perceptual changes<br />
        (such as altered sizes – macropsia and micropsia – as well as
        distortions of time and space)<br />
        and a feeling of alienation from oneself or one's surroundings.

        <br /><br />

        Alice in Wonderland Syndrome is not a distinct medical condition with
        its own diagnosis in the DSM or ICD systems. The term colloquially
        refers to a rare perceptual disorder in which the affected person
        experiences sensory stimuli as distorted or altered – often with altered
        perceptions of the size of people, objects, or themselves. It is
        important to emphasize that this is not a precisely defined clinical
        term, but rather a description of temporary, dramatic perceptual changes
        that can occur in various neurological or psychiatric contexts.

        <br /><br />

        How does this phenomenon arise? In the medical community, it is often
        described in the context of migraine with aura, focal attacks,
        infections of the central nervous system, certain medication side
        effects, or severe sleep disturbances. In migraine, for example, visual
        or spatial distortions may occur, giving the affected person the
        sensation of seeing through glass, dizziness, or an altered object size.
        Similar effects can also occur in episodic neurological disorders in
        which certain brain regions temporarily exhibit abnormal activity.

        <br /><br />

        In addition, stress, lack of sleep, or neurological disorders such as
        epilepsy or strokes in specific regions of the brain can contribute to
        such perceptual changes. In some cases, infectious or inflammatory
        processes in the brain are also diagnosed, which temporarily cause
        multisensory distortions. The experience is often intense and confusing:
        objects appear larger or smaller, shapes may seem distorted, and spatial
        orientation may be severely impaired. At the same time, other cognitive
        functions such as memory or orientation are often preserved, which makes
        the experience particularly disturbing.

        <br /><br />

        It is important that such perceptual distortions always be medically
        investigated. Anyone who notices unusual perceptions episodically should
        seek medical help promptly, especially if accompanied by headaches,
        neurological deficits, fever, confusion, or other neurological symptoms.
        Treatment depends on the underlying cause: For migraines, acute
        painkillers, triptans, or prophylactic medications are often used; for
        infections or inflammations, intensive medical treatment is required;
        for attacks, anticonvulsants or other specific therapies may be
        necessary. Adequate sleep hygiene, stress reduction, and regular medical
        follow-up can also help to reduce recurring episodes.
        <br /><br />
        In summary, the "Alice in Wonderland Syndrome" is more of a figurative
        description of temporary, often focal perceptual changes that occur in
        connection with neurological or medical conditions. It is not a
        independent disease, but a symptomatic phenomenon that requires careful
        medical evaluation.
